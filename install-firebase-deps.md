# Firebase Dependencies Installation

Run the following command to install the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install firebase react-firebase-hooks
```

Or if you're using yarn:

```bash
yarn add firebase react-firebase-hooks
```

These packages are required for the Firebase integration to work properly.
